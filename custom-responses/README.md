# Custom Responses
Insert all your `.yaml` files into here to contain all your responses; the order and number of files does not matter (but note that if you have conflicting responses then the last files' settings will be used).

To add a response to a file, add the message text as a top-level header, then add *two* responses underneath, one for grandmarating and one for grandmalevel (leave one blank if not desired).
