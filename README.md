# Grandma
A silly bot for discord, now public!

The client ID of your bot's discord account is passed via an environment variable (the bot expects `CLIENT_ID`). `custom_responses.yaml` is encrypted; replace if you are going to run them:

To add a response, add the message text as a top-level header, then add *two* responses underneath, one for grandmarating and one for grandmalevel (leave one blank if not desired).
