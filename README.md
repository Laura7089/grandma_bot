# Grandma
A silly bot for discord, now public!

clientID.txt and custom_responses.yaml are both encrypted; replace these if you are going to run them:

## clientID.txt
Paste the clientID of your bot's account in this file, raw

## custom_responses.yaml
To add a response, add the message text as a top-level header, then add *two* responses underneath, one for grandmarating and one for grandmalevel (leave one blank if not desired).
